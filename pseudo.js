// GETTING USER INPUT
// 1. Build out how our inquirer is going to work
    // ask questions to build a manager
        // what is your manager's name, id, email, office number
        // once you get the answers, this will probably finish one inquirer and you will build the manager

// 2. Ask whether you want to add an engineer, intern, or nothing else
    // ask questions to build an engineer
        // what is your engineers' name, id, email, github username
    // ask questions to build an intern
        // what is your intern's name, id, email, school

// 3. Figure our how to repeat until the 'no more team members' option is chosen

// CLASSES

// 2. Write the properties and methods that each class expects



// .then(function (answers) {

// })
// type
// name
// message
// validate: (answer) => 
// if (answer !== )

// type
// name
